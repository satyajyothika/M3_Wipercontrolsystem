## Requirements

## Introduction

A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water from a vehicle's front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses and train locomotives are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.  The wiper blades are made of rubber and must apply enough pressure to the windshield in order to remove all moisture without any streaks. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility, from its surface.
